# **Report on ESG and Financial Performance Analysis for TDI**

## **Introduction**

**Background:** 
 The Data Immersed (TDI). TDI is delving into ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) metrics and their impact on company performance across various industries and regions. Your role is to design an ESG-Financial Performance Dashboard to identify trends, analyze risks, and support decision-making for sustainable investment strategies. 

**Objective:**
This project aims to explore the relationship between ESG performance and financial outcomes in TDI, identifying key challenges and answering strategic questions to support sustainable business decision-making.

**Problem Statement**
In today’s business environment, ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors are increasingly influencing investment decisions and corporate strategies.
Yet, the direct link between ESG performance and financial outcomes is not well defined.

**This project addresses the following key questions:**

•	Which companies are high vs. low ESG performers, and how does that relate to their financial results?

•	Which ESG pillar (E, S, or G) has the strongest correlation with financial success?

•	Are there industry or regional patterns in ESG scores that influence profitability and performance?

**Goal:**
To uncover data-driven insights into how ESG practices impact company financials—empowering stakeholders to make more informed, sustainable decisions.

**Statistical Analysis: Using Pivot Table**

•	Sum of Revenue

•	Average Profit Margin

•	Average Market Cap

•	Average Growth Rate

•	Average ESG Overall Score

•	Average Carbon Emissions

•	Average ESG by sector and region

•	ESG vs Profit Margin

•	Total Revenue: $51.38 Trillion

•	 Average Profit Margin: 10.9%

•	Average Market Cap: $13.38 billion

•	 Average Growth Rate: 4.8%

•	Average ESG Overall Score: 54.6

**By Region:**

•	Europe leads in ESG Overall (67.87).

•	Middle East have the least on ESG scores (43.4) with Africa following closely.

 **By ESG Category:**

•	Also top in Revenue and Market Cap

•	Low ESG companies:

•	Have the lowest revenue and ESG scores

**Discussions/Recommendations:**

Africa and the Middle East show significantly lower ESG scores, highlighting an urgent need for governance reforms, environmental initiatives, and social programs.

Energy, Utilities, and Transportation industries are major carbon emitters and should focus on renewable transitions, carbon capture technologies, and operational efficiency improvements.

Companies with low ESG ratings but high revenues present opportunities for targeted ESG upskilling and public transparency improvements.

Strategic investments should prioritize Medium ESG companies with rising financial and ESG performance, as they are poised for strong market revaluation.

Technology, Healthcare, and Finance industries demonstrate both financial resilience and a growing commitment to sustainability, making them attractive targets.

Green technology sectors, such as clean energy startups and climate-focused AI, offer high potential for ESG-driven investment growth.

FinTech companies incorporating ESG principles into their models are emerging as leaders in responsible finance.

Overall, focusing on governance improvements, renewable transitions, medium ESG risers and green technologies forms a powerful ESG strategy.
